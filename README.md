# The fuckifier  

Part of the super-duper shit apps (to test various Python functions) series.
<br>----------<br>
Testing the NLTK tagging facility.<p>
Will add fucks to your sentences so that you don't have to give any.<p>
No, seriously, all that it literally does is just takes your input string and adds various grammatical forms of "fuck" to it depending on the part of speech.<p>
PS: No attention to good programming practices or readability is given. Literally the only reason for this program's existence is to see what NLTK will tag as which part of speech.
